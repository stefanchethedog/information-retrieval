œCame away poorer than when I went. But such
a place to live! Those silences at the back of the north wind _got_ me.
Iâ€™ve never belonged to myself since.â€

Yet he was not a great talker. He told a great deal in a few
well-chosen wordsâ€”how well-chosen Valancy did not realise. And he had a
knack of saying things without opening his mouth at all.

â€œI like a man whose eyes say more than his lips,â€ thought Valancy.

But then she liked everything about himâ€”his tawny hairâ€”his whimsical
smilesâ€”the little glints of fun in his eyesâ€”his loyal affection for
that unspeakable Lady Janeâ€”his habit of sitting with his hands in his
pockets, his chin sunk on his breast, looking up from under his
mismated eyebrows. She liked his nice voice which sounded as if it
might become caressing or wooing with very little provocation. She was
at times almost afraid to let herself think these thoughts. They were
so vivid that she felt as if the others _must_ know what she was
thinking.

â€œIâ€™ve been watching a woodpecker all day,â€ he said one evening on the
shaky old back verandah. His account of the woodpeckerâ€™s doings was
satisfying. He had often some gay or cunning little anecdote of the
wood folk to tell them. And sometimes he and Roaring Abel smoked
fiercely the whole evening and never said a word, while Cissy lay in
the hammock swung between the verandah posts and Valancy sat idly on
the steps, her hands clasped over her knees, and wondered dreamily if
she were really Valancy Stirling and if it were only three weeks since
she had left the ugly old house on Elm Street.

The barrens lay before her in a white moon splendour, where dozens of
little rabbits frisked. Barney, when he liked, could sit down on the
edge of the barrens and lure those rabbits right to him by some
mysterious sorcery he possessed. Valancy had once seen a squirrel leap
from a scrub pine to his shoulder and sit there chattering to him. It
reminded her of John Foster.

It was one of the delights of Valancyâ€™s new life that she could read
John Fosterâ€™s books as often and as long as she liked. She could read
them in bed if she wanted to. She read them all to Cissy, who loved
them. She also tried to read them to Abel and Barney, who did not love
them. Abel was bored and Barney politely refused to listen at all.

â€œPiffle,â€ said Barney.

Of course, the Stirlings had not left the poor maniac alone all this
time or refrained from heroic efforts to
