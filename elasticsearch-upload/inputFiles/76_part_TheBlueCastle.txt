â€œPerfectly. And hate them.â€

â€œDo you realise what people will say? What they _are_ saying?â€

â€œI can imagine it,â€ said Valancy, with a shrug of her shoulders. She
was suddenly free of fear again. â€œI havenâ€™t listened to the gossip of
Deerwood teaparties and sewing circles twenty years for nothing. But,
Dr. Stalling, it doesnâ€™t matter in the least to me what they sayâ€”not in
the least.â€

Dr. Stalling went away then. A girl who cared nothing for public
opinion! Over whom sacred family ties had no restraining influence! Who
hated her childhood memories!

Then Cousin Georgiana cameâ€”on her own initiative, for nobody would have
thought it worth while to send her. She found Valancy alone, weeding
the little vegetable garden she had planted, and she made all the
platitudinous pleas she could think of. Valancy heard her patiently.
Cousin Georgiana wasnâ€™t such a bad old soul. Then she said:

â€œAnd now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin
Georgiana, can you tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will
not be as thick as porridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?â€

â€œWeâ€™ll just have to _wait_,â€ said Uncle Benjamin. â€œAfter all, Cissy Gay

Mrs. Frederick wept. It would really have been so much easier to bear
if Valancy had died. She could have worn mourning then.

When Abel Gay paid Valancy her first monthâ€™s wagesâ€”which he did
promptly, in bills reeking with the odour of tobacco and
whiskeyâ€”Valancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent of it. She got
a pretty green crÃªpe dress with a girdle of crimson beads, at a bargain
sale, a pair of silk stockings, to match, and a little crinkled green
hat with a crimson rose in it. She even bought a foolish little
beribboned and belaced nightgown.

She passed the house on Elm Street twiceâ€”Valancy never even thought
about it as â€œhomeâ€â€”but saw no one. No doubt her mother was sitting in
the room this lovely June evening playing solitaireâ€”and cheating.
Valancy knew that Mrs. Frederick always cheated. She never lost a game.
Most of the people Valancy met looked at her seriously and passed her
with a cool nod. Nobody stopped to speak to her.

Valancy put on her green dress when she got home. Then she took it off
again. She felt so miserably undressed in its low neck and short
sleeves. And that low, crimson girdle around the hips seemed po
