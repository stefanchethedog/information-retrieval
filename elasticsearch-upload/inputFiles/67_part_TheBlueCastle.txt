”Father only wants his meals cooked. I
donâ€™t think you are strong yourself. You turn so pale sometimes. And
those drops you take. _Are_ you well, dear?â€

â€œIâ€™m all right,â€ said Valancy lightly. She would not have Cissy
worried. â€œAnd Iâ€™m not working hard. Iâ€™m glad to have some work to
doâ€”something that really wants to be done.â€

â€œThenâ€â€”Cissy slipped her hand wistfully into Valancyâ€™sâ€”â€œdonâ€™t letâ€™s
talk any more about my being sick. Letâ€™s just forget it. Letâ€™s pretend
Iâ€™m a little girl againâ€”and you have come here to play with me. I used
to wish that long agoâ€”wish that you could come. I knew you couldnâ€™t, of
course. But how I did wish it! You always seemed so different from the
other girlsâ€”so kind and sweetâ€”and as if you had something in yourself
nobody knew aboutâ€”some dear, pretty secret. _Had_ you, Valancy?â€

â€œI had my Blue Castle,â€ said Valancy, laughing a little. She was
pleased that Cissy had thought of her like this. She had never

â€œEvery one has a Blue Castle, I think,â€ said Cissy softly. â€œOnly every
one has a different name for it. _I_ had mineâ€”once.â€

She put her two thin little hands over her face. She did not tell
Valancyâ€”thenâ€”who had destroyed her Blue Castle. But Valancy knew that,
whoever it was, it was not Barney Snaith.




CHAPTER XVIII


Valancy was acquainted with Barney by nowâ€”well acquainted, it seemed,
though she had spoken to him only a few times. But then she had felt
just as well acquainted with him the first time they had met. She had
been in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks of white
narcissus for Cissyâ€™s room when she heard that terrible old Grey
Slosson coming down through the woods from Mistawisâ€”one could hear it
miles away. Valancy did not look up as it drew near, thumping over the
rocks in that crazy lane. She had never looked up, though Barney had
gone racketting past every evening since she had been at Roaring
Abelâ€™s. This time he did not racket past. The old Grey Slosson stopped
with even more terrible noises than it made going. Valancy was
conscious that Barney had sprung from it and was leaning over the
ramshackle gate. She suddenly straightened up and looked into his face.
Their eyes metâ€”Valancy was suddenly conscious of a delicious weakness.
Was one of her h
